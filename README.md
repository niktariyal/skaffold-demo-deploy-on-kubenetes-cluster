# skaffold-demo-deploy-on-kubenetes-cluster

This is for rapid development deployment and testing related. Skaffold is really good in terms of coding and deploying application and testing fast.

For the configuration related we need to download the skaffold binary and set the path for this. Skaffold can be used with (kubectl, docker, custer...)

Here on this project I am using skaffold v1.0.0.
Here are 3 samples
1) skaffold deployment via kubectl
2) skaffold deployment via docker
3) docker-compose deployment
